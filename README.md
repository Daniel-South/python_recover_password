# python_recover_password

Oops! You can't remember one of your passwords. There are so many to remember these days; it could happen to anyone.

Luckily, you have two pieces of information that could potentially help you to recover your lost password.
First, you have a hash string of the encrypted password.

Second, you recall that the password might be based on your dog's name (Sparky) followed by a number.
There might be a special character between Sparky and the number, but you're not sure.
Sparky33
Sparky.99
etc.


DISCLAIMER

Please do not use this method to guess other people's passwords. Even if they have a weak password
like Sparky63, they are entitled to their privacy. Hacking is frowned upon and could get you in a
lot of trouble. Please be a good citizen.

Further, if YOU have a weak password, and let's face it, you probably have at least one somewhere,
please consider making it stronger. This program shows how easy it is to crack a weak password
if someone knows a little bit about you.


EXECUTION

To run the program and recover Sparky's password:

python sparky.py
